# Observational-Experiment-with-RCBD
- We decide to design and perform an experimental study on the data from ​Island​, including both treatment factors and nuisance factors
- We will generate a random sample as our treatment group, perform the treatments and collect our experimental data
- We will analyse our data using multiple statistical methods, including: ANOVA, regression model, normality tests, power calculation, etc.
- In the end, we will conclude our discovery with a comparison with the real world situation and a discussion on our limitations
